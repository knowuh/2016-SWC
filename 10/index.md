## New problem set [ps-10](ps-10.html)


## Review problem set 09:  6:00 – 7:00
* Review [ps-09](../09/ps-09.html)
 

### SVG 7:00 - 7:30
- What is SVG?
- When would we use it?
- How can we use it?
  - embedded image
  - inline with `<img src="foo.svg"/>`
- Write some SVG by hand
- Export some SVG from figma
- Restyle it with css
- Using [Snap SVG](http://snapsvg.io/docs/) to draw & animate SVG.
- Simple code-pen example

### D3 7:30 - 8:45
- What is it?
- Why or when would we use it?
- How do we use it?
- Go over the [example](d3-test.html)
- Do a D3 experiment from scratch in code-pen.

### UPDATE: (Important!): 
In our in-class example, we added the circles width ('r') as s CSS property. This isn't supported on all browsers. Instead, its best to specify R in the SVG or using D3 sett
